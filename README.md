# decision boundaries boiler plate stuff

## Requirements

We recommend using `anaconda` or `miniconda` for python. Our code has been tested with `python=3.8` on linux.

Create a conda environment from the yml file and activate it.
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate dbviz_env
```

Make sure the following requirements are met

* torch>=1.8.1
* torchvision>=0.9.1

We used wandb to log most of the outputs.
```
conda install -c conda-forge wandb 
```

## Training the model and plotting the decision boundary

We provide wide variety of models, please see models folder to see the exhasutive list. Train the model with following command.
```
python main.py --net <model_name> --set_seed <init_seed> --save_net <model_save_path> --active_log --epochs <number_epochs> --lr <suitable_learningrate>
```



## Reproducibility experiments
Once you have a saved model, we save prediction arrays for this model by running the following command: 
```
python save_preds.py --load_net /path/to/your/saved/models --epochs 500 --resolution 50
```
Here, epochs is a stand-in for number of runs, and resolution determines the grid resolution for sampling. 

Then, we calculate the reproducibility matrix by running the following command: 

```
python calculate_iou.py --load_net /path/to/your/saved/models 
```

These two scripts also contain more information about the structure of saved models that is needed.
